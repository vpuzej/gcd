Getting and Cleaning Data Project

R function "run_analysis" was developed to 

  1)  Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2)  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3)  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4)  Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names  and save that data set as output4.txt in working directory

  5)  From the data set in step 4, create a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
      This dataset is saved as output5.txt in working directory.
